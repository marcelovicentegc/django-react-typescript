## Development directions

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/marcelovicentegc/django-react-typescript.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate it ☝️: `source venv/bin/activate` or `venv\Scripts\activate` if you're on a Windows
4. Install dependencies: `npm i && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd frontend && npm i`
5. Setup the project `.env` file by taking as example the `.env.example` on the root folder (refer to [configuration](#Configuration) for more details)
6. Setup the frontend app's `frontend/.env` file by taking as example the `frontend/.env.example` file (refer to [configuration](#Configuration) for more details)
7. Start the application: `npm start` (make sure Postgres is up and running)

## Configuration

You should configure these variables on a `.env` file on the root folder for the global configuration and a `.env` file for the frontend configuration under `frontend/.env` when developing. As for deploying the app, **you will need to set the same set of dev variables + some variables exclusively used in production environments as [_secrets_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)**.

## Deployment worfklows

### Virtualized Deploy Workflow

Branches `hml` and `prd` will trigger this workflow.

![Deploy workflow](./assets/DeployWorkflow.jpg)

### Host Deploy Workflow

For this kind of deploy to work, you will need a running Postgres database, Nginx, and Supervisor processes.

## Basic architecture
